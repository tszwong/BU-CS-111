Problem Set 9: Problem 0
Put your response to the reading below.


1. Suppose that pivot searching was readily available to you. To what extent could you imagine using it? Do you feel it would make you more productive – or would this type of search remain largely unused in the way you interact with computation and electronic materials?
I doubt I would make use of pivot searching even if it was readily available to me. First, I like privacy so having software constantly track and monitor my online activity is not something I would like. Second, there are many softwares, perhaps helpful or perhaps not, that are installed on my devices but remain largely unused. I think this is a cool idea, however, I do not think it is useful for myself, in fact, I think it would hinder my productivity and possibly causes other problems.
