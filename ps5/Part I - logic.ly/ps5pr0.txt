1. I think the first disadvantage still exists because we are always trying to find faster and more efficient algorithms to solve problems while minimizing run-time and memory usage. When we do duplicate calculations or function calls it slows down the program and/or machine. 


2. High-level languages have large libraries of methods and functions that are already made and implemented as part of the language, allowing things to be done in less lines or calculations.
