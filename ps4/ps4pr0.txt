I agree with Kurzweil’s view that technology will have a positive impact on human development.  This is because with the use of technology, we are capable of solving and carrying out various tasks much more efficiently and quickly. However, even with the rate technology is improving, there are some tasks that Kurzweil predicts such as creating an avatar of a dead person or living forever is still likely impossible for a very long time.
